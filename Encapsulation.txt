 Binding up all the properties and method of the class is known Encapsulation and Encapsulation help us to achieve the abstraction whih hide the information which is not important for the user .

2.What is important features of Encapsulation ?

  Data Abstraction
  Data Hiding

3.What are the getter and setter method in java expali with example ?
  Setter and getter method are used to set and get the value of instance variable in the class.

  example 
  public class student{
  int age;
  String name;

  }
   public void get()
  {
     System.out.println(age);
     System.out.println(name);

  }

5.What is advantage of Encapsulation
  Data Abstraction
  Data Hiding

6.How to achieve Encapsulation in java ?
