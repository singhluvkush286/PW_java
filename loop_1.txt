1. What are the conditional operators in Java ?
 In java there are 3 types of conditional operators
 1. AND operators
 2. OR operators
 3. NOT operators 
 
2. What are the types of operators present in java based on operand?
 Types of Operators in java 
 1. Assignment Operators
 2. Arithmetic Operators
 3. Logical Operators
 4. Relational Operators
 5. Increment or Decrement Operators

3. What is the use of switch case in java ? 
   Switch case is used to select one block out of many block.

4. What  are the priority level of arithmetic operators in java ?
   * / % + -

5. what are the Conditional statements and the use of conditional statements?
In java there are four types of conditional operators:-
     1. if-statement
        If the condition inside the if statement is true then the if block will be executed otherwise it will skip
        the if block . 
     2. if-else statement
        If the condition inside the if statement is true then if block will be executed otherwise else block will
        be executed .
     3. else-if ladder
        It will check all the if condition , and whichever condition is true that block of code will be executed
        if no condition is true then else block will be executed.

     4. Nested if-else statement
        When if-else is present inside the if statement then it is called the nested if-else statement

       The main use of if statement is to check the condition between two blocks of statement .

6. what is the syntax of if-else statement?
  if(condition-statement)
 {
      --- if block statement --
 }
else 
{
  --- else block statement ---
}


7 what are three iterative statements in java  ?
Three iterative statement are .
1. for- loop
2. While loop 
3. do-while loop


8. Write the difference between for-loop and do- while loop ?

   for-loop
    General syntax --
     for(initialisation; condition; increment or Decrement)
{
    for-loop block
}
While-loop
    General syntax -
do
{
    do-while loop block
}While(condition);



9. Write a program to print number between 1 to 10 .

import java.util.*;
public class program
{
   public static void main(String[]     args)
  {
   int  num;
   for(num=0;num<=10;num++)
  {
     System.out.println(num);
  }
}
}
