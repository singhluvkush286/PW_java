1. What is the Inheritance in java ?

  Inheritance is a process in which child class acquire a properties of parent class . In java we can achive inheritance by
  using extends keyword .

2.What is the superclass and sub-class in java ?

 Parent class of the every class which is declare is known as super class .
 By default super class of every class is Object class .
 
 Sub-class is class which is derived from the parent class , by default parent class of every class is Object class .

3.How is inheriatnce achieve and implementesd in Java ?

  Inheritance is achieved by extends keyword in java & we can achieve code reusibilty in java .

4.What is Polymorphism in java ?

  Polymorphism is process in which we can represnt one thing in many ways.

5.Differeniate b/w Method overloading and overriding ?

  method overloading-
         
     * Compile time Polymorphism
     * It can be done without Inheritance .
     * It can't depend on the prototype of the method.  
  
   method overriding -
         
     * Run time Polymorphism
     * It can't be done without Inheritance .
     * It is depend on the prototype of the method.  

6.What is the abstraction explain with example ?

  Abstraction of hidding the implementation part from the user .
  To achieve abstraction in java we can use abstract keyword in java .

  Example 

  abstract class Animal {
    protected String name;
    protected int age;
    
    public Animal(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
    
    public abstract void makeSound();
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    public Dog(String name, int age) {
        super(name, age);
    }
    
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Woof!");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    public Cat(String name, int age) {
        super(name, age);
    }
    
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Meow!");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myDog = new Dog("Fido", 3);
        Animal myCat = new Cat("Fluffy", 2);
        
        myDog.makeSound(); // Output: Woof!
        myCat.makeSound(); // Output: Meow!
    }
}


7. Differenciate b/w Anstract method and final method ?
 
  abstract method doen't have the implemntation part in it , it only have declaration part in it .
  while final method have the implementation part in it , but it can't be overriden in child class .

8.What is the final class in java ?

  Final class is class which can't be modify further , final classs can't be particiapte in Inheritance.

9.Differnciate between abstraction and Encapsulation ?
 
  Abstraction:
   Abstraction is a process of focusing on the essential features of an object and ignoring the non-essential features. It 
   allows you to create a model of a real-world object by focusing only on the most important characteristics. Abstraction
   is achieved using abstract classes and interfaces in Java.

  Encapsulation:
    Encapsulation is a technique of hiding the implementation details of an object from the outside world and providing
    a public interface to access the object. Encapsulation ensures that the data is accessed only through defined 
    methods and protects the data from unauthorized access. Encapsulation is achieved using access modifiers such 
    as private, protected, and public in Java.


10.Differenciate b/w runtime polymorphism and compile time polymorphism ?

  Polymrphism which is achieve at the runtime is known as runtime polymorphism and the polymorphism which is achieve at 
  the compile is known as compile time polymorphism .
