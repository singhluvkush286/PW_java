1. How do you concate two string in java ? Give example 

  We can concate String in java with two ways :-
  
  i.  Using concat() method in java
      String s1,s2,s3;
      s1="Java";
      s2="programming";
      s3=s1.concat(s2);
      
      it will concat both the string make a new string object , it can't make any change 
      in existing string.
   
  ii. Using + Operatorin java  
      String s1,s2,s3;
      s1="Java";
      s2="programming";
      s3=s1+s2;
      
      it will concat both the string make a new string object in the heap memory ,
      it can't make any change in existing string.
      Using + operator we can concat as many string we want.

2. How do you find length of string in java ?
   
  Using length() method we can find the length of the string .
  
  example:-
   
  s1="Java";
  s1.length();

  it will return 4 as length of string in java.

3.How do you compare two string in java ?
   We can compare String in java with two ways :-
  
  i.  Using equals() method in java
      String s1,s2,s3;
      s1="Java";
      s2="programming";
      s1.equals(s2);
      
      it will compare the content of the string , return true if the content of both the 
      string is same .
      Above string will return false, because the content of both the string is different.
   
  ii. Using == Operatorin java  
      String s1,s2,s3;
      s1="Java";
      s2="programming";
      s1==s2;
      
      it will compare the reference of the string , return true if the reference of both the 
      string is same .
      Above string will return false, because the reference of both the string is 
      different.
